I'm Beena Khurana and I'm director of the
MBA program at the California

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:12.870
Polytechnic State University in San Luis
Obispo. When people ask me why they

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:18.000
should consider getting an MBA at Cal
Poly, I generally respond by asking them

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.279
why they want to get an MBA in the first
place. I think if you're looking for a

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:28.949
degree that rewards personally, professionally, and of course financially,

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.840
then an MBA is for you. If you are
looking to be treated like the

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.500
individual who you are, then Cal Poly is
the place for you.

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:45.440
We're a collaborative, supportive, intimate (aka small) community. Our faculty

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:51.329
is this winsome combination of fierce
intellect with a passion for teaching.

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:58.880
So if you're ready to give it your all for
10 months, we want to be a part of that journey.
