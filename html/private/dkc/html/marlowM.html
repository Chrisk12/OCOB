            <p>Cal Poly named Dr. Marlow a University Distinguished Scholar in 2007. His research has examined numerous issues associated with spending, taxation and regulatory policies of government. His most recent research has focused on public health economics. He has published over 70 articles in refereed journals that include Review of Economics and Statistics, Public Choice, Applied Economics, Economic Inquiry, Economics Letters, Regulation, Economic Affairs and the Journal of American Physicians and Surgeons. He serves as a referee for numerous publications that include the New England Journal of Medicine, Journal of Health Economics, European Journal of Health Economics and Applied Economics.</p>
            <p>Dr. Marlow's book "The Myth of Fair and Efficient Government: Why the Government You Want Is Not the One You Get" was published in 2011 by Praeger Publishing. This book demonstrates why romantic views of government promote a less efficient economy; why so many government programs are inefficient in practice; and why a more limited role for government is critical to reviving trust in government. 1995, he published the textbook "Public Finance: Theory & Practice" for Harcourt. Dr. Marlow has taught a wide range of courses both at the undergraduate and graduate levels. In 2009, he received a teaching award from Lockheed Martin Aeronautics Company.</p>
            <p>Prior to coming to Cal Poly in 1988, he held positions at the U. S. Treasury and George Washington University. At the U.S. Treasury, he conducted research on monetary and fiscal policies for the Under Secretary for Monetary Affairs and the Assistant Secretary for Economic Policy. He is a Phi Beta Kappa graduate of George Washington University where he was awarded a BA in Economics in 1975. He received his PhD in Economics from Virginia Tech in 1978.</p>
