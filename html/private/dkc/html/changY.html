      <p class="Content">Dr. Chang’s expertise is in the area of Product Lifecycle Management (PLM). He used to work for a major home appliance company in Taiwan as the project coordinator for a pilot study project of PRO/E introduction, and was responsible to streamline the workflow for this company and its suppliers. Prior to coming to Cal Poly, he worked closely with companies including IBM, Boeing, Chrysler, as well as the PLM software vendors including Enovia, Delmia, and SmarTeam to investigate functionality and deployment roadblocks of commercially available PLM systems. Those collaborative projects with major industry partners eventually led to the establishment of Purdue PLM Center of Excellence and served as the foundation of later projects. Dr. Chang has served in the editorial advisory board for a Taiwanese magazine, <em>CADesigner</em>, for more than 15 years.</p>
      <p class="Content">One area of Dr. Chang’s current research focuses on issues of user-centered product design. On-going research projects include adaptive instructional design for manual assembly operations, mental map construction during spatial learning, semiotic analysis of assembly instructions, and feasibility study of multi-touch technology for virtual object manipulation. Another area of Dr. Chang’s research on is on the practices of technology commercialization; he has conducted research on solar vehicle profile design and the corresponding energy collection pattern; he also built a more realistic cost model for hydrogen-based fuel cell public transit deployment in the Central Coast area. Dr. Chang is also interested in the mechatronics device design for healthcare, packaging, and supply chain/logistic applications. </p>
      <p class="Content">Dr. Chang received his PhD in Technology and MS in Industrial Engineering from Purdue University. He earned his MS in Mechanical Engineering from Carnegie Mellon University and his BS in Mechanical Engineering from Tatung Institute of Technology, Taiwan. Dr. Chang is currently responsible for the delivery of IT Product Development curriculum, a set of three project-oriented courses designed to prepare students critical skills for their pursuing of expertise in the area of packaging, technology entrepreneurship, and value chain.      </p>
