      <p class="Content">Dr. Coget is an active researcher in the field of Organizational Behavior. His core research focus explores how rational, intuitive, and emotional processes interact to influence decision-making in a variety of settings, such as the film, medical, and wine industries. For example, his forthcoming article in the Journal of Management Inquiry (March 2010) examines how intuition, reasoning, and emotions interact when ER doctors make critical decisions. He and Dr. Stern Neill, from CalPoly, are currently seeking funding from the National Science Foundation (NSF) to explore the psychological factors that facilitate innovation in the wine industry. He is an editorial board member of the Journal of Organizational Behavior, has published several peer-reviewed articles in the field of management, and presented numerous papers at international academic conferences.</p>
      <p class="Content">Dr. Coget’s personal commitment is to change the quality and character of work through Organizational Behavior, and other classes he teaches. As a teacher, this translates in helping students derive from their experience with people personally meaningful perspectives that will transform their managerial practice and enrich their humanity. His teaching style resolutely adopts CalPoly’s “Learning by doing” philosophy. He engages his students through a variety of cases and exercises that translate in changes of behavior, and not mere memorization of concepts. Dr. Coget is co-author with other CalPoly colleagues of a leading textbook in Organizational Behavior: “Behavior in Organizations: An experiential approach.” Thanks to a gift from Bank of America, he also contributes to the development of San Luis Obispo County’s economy by leading groups of students in consulting with local companies in the field of tourism to help them grow.</p>
      <p class="Content">Dr. Coget earned his PhD from the Anderson School at UCLA in 2004, and was a faculty member at HEC Paris until 2006. Prior to his PhD, he earned his MS in Management at HEC Paris. His work experiences include working on the trading floor of Morgan Stanley in Paris, and serving as Naval Attaché at the French Embassy in Portugal. He joined CalPoly in 2006.</p></td>
