      <p>Dr. Hess is a pioneer in the science of consumer brand relationships.&nbsp; The models and measures he has developed are used extensively in industry and his foundational consumer trust measure (Hess 1995) is commonly cited in the academic marketing literature by those currently researching <strong>consumer-brand relationships.</strong>&nbsp; His work is published in trade and peer reviewed academic publications, and he continues to advance relationship science by formalizing the Consumer Investment Model.<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
        He has consulted with over 100 companies in a twenty year research career including Microsoft, McDonald’s, Sony and a wide variety of automotive and telecommunications firms.&nbsp; At least two large marketing research firms are currently using Dr. Hess’ consumer relationship model as their primary brand loyalty platform.&nbsp; </p>
      <p>Jeff received his PhD in Marketing Research Methodology from the University of Colorado, Boulder. He earned his MBA in Marketing from Pepperdine University and a BA in Radio, TV and Film from Biola University.&nbsp; He currently teaches a variety of marketing and marketing research classes, specializing in training students to apply data analytic techniques toward answering strategic marketing questions – using real world data and methods.</p>
      <p class="Content"><strong>Current Project</strong>:</p>
      <p>The &ldquo;Obama Survey&rdquo; substitutes brand relationships with those with public figures (and political organizations) and will answer the following questions:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>What is the nature and strength of people&rsquo;s relationships with Obama (and Palin, Hillary Clinton (perhaps Schwarzenegger) and the major political parties and Tiger Woods)?</li>
        <li>How did they get that way?</li>
        <li>Do different kinds of people (according to psycho/demographic profiles) have different kinds of relationships?</li>
        <li>How does all this interact with the kind of media sources people use and rating of said sources&rsquo; credibility?</li>
        <li>How do we expect people to behave as a result (voting, donating $$ etc.)?</li>
        <li>Do they trust these people and organizations and are they invested in their success etc.?</li>
      </ol>
