                Richard Carter managed his own building contracting and cabinet/mill manufacturing company in North Island New Zealand for sixteen memorable years. </p>
              <p>A second career in Information Systems began with Analyst positions twice with IBM in South San Jose (JIT mainframes), and once with Applied Magnetics in Goleta (DASD Composite Heads). In January 1993 after completing his MBA at Cal Poly, Richard began teaching Management Information Systems at the Cal Poly Orfalea College of Business. </p>
              <p>Starting February 1994, his teaching at Cal Poly was augmented for seven years by director-level management of information systems at Apio, a national 7x24 cold chain -based fresh produce company famous for the “Broccoligate” of President George Bush Senior, and for innovating carton-pack systems in field harvesting. While teaching MIS, major projects at Apio in partnership with Ernst and Young included System Integrations, Business Process Improvement, ERP System Selection, EDI-based Ecommerce, and taking Apio public through its acquisition by the applied research -based Landec (LNDC) of Menlo Park, CA. As part of a fast-growing department of 12, five former MIS “grade-A” Students from his MGT321 (now BUS391) course were employed at Apio as direct reports. </p>
              <p>At the height of the dot com boom in October of 2000, Richard became Director of Operations and Information Systems at TrueLink Inc. owned by Lehman Brothers (now TrueCredit Inc. owned by Transunion), notable for being the first company to source credit reports on the Internet. TrueLink was also a majority employer of Cal Poly Graduates. </p>
              <p>Richard continues to do information systems management and supply chain consulting through database management, Unix systems administration and shell programming, and transaction processing for high system availability and EDI integrity. He also assists his three grown children in their own highly successful Surf Resort (Mentawai Islands Sumatra), Dairy Manufacturing (New Zealand), and Sound Engineering (Chicago) businesses. </p>
              <p>Richard enthusiastically supports the teaching mission of the CSU with a multi-customer philosophy of preparing students for successful value-add careers in their communities, particularly by recognizing the needs of organizations for productive, and socially-responsible, team members. Students who “hit the ground running” attract recruiters. </p>
