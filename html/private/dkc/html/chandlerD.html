<p class="Content">Since her hire at CalPoly in 2006, Dr. Chandler has begun to build a reputation in the mentoring and career fields and has taught over 20 sections of Organizational Behavior, a foundational undergraduate business course. In the winter of 2010, she will teach graduate and undergraduate negotiations. As a testament to her commitment to teaching, she received the Outstanding Faculty for Management award this past year, 2008-2009.</p>
      <p class="Content">She has 16 publications in various journals and books, including high-quality journals like <em>Journal of Organizational Behavior, Journal of Vocational Behavior, Career Development International, Action Research</em>, and <em>Organizational Dynamics</em> and an organizational behavior textbook. In August of 2009, her co-authored piece, “How to Be a Smart Protégé” was featured in the <em>Wall Street Journal.</em>&nbsp; She serves as an ad hoc reviewer for four journals, has made numerous presentations at international conferences, and has organized several research symposia and professional development workshops.</p>
      <p class="Content">At the core of Dr. Chandler’s research interests is<strong> how individuals vary in their approach and ability to enlist others in their career, leadership and personal development</strong>. Her research on &quot;Relational Savvy&quot;, for example, suggests that rather than relying on a formal mentor to provide all of one's career needs, a person should proactively foster a network of &quot;developers&quot; who provide varying types of developmental support. As a consequence, organizations should consider complementing their formal mentoring programs with interventions that stimulate people's thinking about their existing mentoring networks and how they can better nurture responsive networks through their own efforts. </p>
      <p class="Content">In her research and teaching, Dr. Chandler draws upon her professional experience as a financial recruiter (“headhunter”) and management trainee. Prior to entering the doctoral program at Boston University, while a financial recruiter, she cultivated skills that can help heighten students’ ability to secure jobs of interest to them. As a result, she actively mentors students in the way of interviewing skills, resume and cover letter writing, career development, and salary negotiations.</p>
      <p class="Content">She currently serves on the University’s Status on Women Committee and as an adviser for Alpha Kappa Psi, a business fraternity, and the CalPoly Consulting Club. </p>
