                Jonathan York is an entrepreneur and educator who has dedicated his career to helping companies succeed and students learn the issues of entrepreneurship. He recently joined the faculty of the Orfalea College of Business at Cal Poly in San Luis Obispo as the first professor dedicated to entrepreneurship, where he is focused on helping students understand and experience the challenges of management and decision-making in growth comapnies. </p>
              <p>As a CEO and consultant, he has worked for years in entrepreneurial companies facing key strategic and operational issues: readiness to raise capital; marketing and sales development; people and team issues; board and investor relations; product development. Long-term relationships have involved Jon in assisting his clients in everything from business planning and raising growth and start-up capital, to managing rapid growth and seeking exit opportunities. </p>
              <p>A seasoned executive, consultant and trusted advisor to corporate leaders, Dr. York has raised over $100M in funding and participated in the financing and development of over a dozen technology and services companies. He has been on both sides of the venture capital and angel financing equation, as a CEO and recipient of significant investment, and as an active venture investor. His experience in these realms makes him an ideal partner for ventures looking to move to the next stage of growth. <br />
                In addition to his technology venture background, Jon brings a track record of thirty years of CEO experience in health care, economic development, government and technology. He designed and now teaches the entrepreneurship course in the Executive MBA Program at Fisher College of Business, Ohio State University. </p>
              <p>As an operating CEO, Dr. York has led companies through both rapid growth and in difficult times, and knows intimately all aspects of the leadership equation. He was the President and CEO of the Columbus Chamber, one of the country’s largest and most aggressive economic development organizations. Prior to that, Jon served as a CEO for over ten years in the health care sector, running large and complex behavioral healthcare systems. In 1996, he started and grew a software company through “Web 1.0.” Before forming Jonathan York &amp; Associates, he served as a general partner in an early-stage technology venture capital firm. </p>
