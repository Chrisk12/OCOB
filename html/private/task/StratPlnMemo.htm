</P>

<P>As previously announced, the college is participating in the Ernst &amp; Young Foundation's
Strategic Planning Partnership program, thanks to a grant from the EY Foundation.  The  purpose
of this partnership project is to provide assistance in the strategic management process.  Michael
Moore and Michael Diamond (the two Mikes) will facilitate a process in which the college's
strategic planning team examines the challenges and opportunities for the college, evaluates its
strategic alternatives, and either affirms or initiates changes in its current focus. <BR WP="BR2">
</P>

<P><STRONG>The Approach</STRONG></P>

<P>The project is structured around a series of facilitated, participative workshops, using Ernst &amp;
Young's Focus™ methodology, a step-by-step process that will help the team of faculty, staff,
administrators and other key stakeholders examine the college's mission, resources, strengths,
opportunity areas and risks.  The Focus process also assists the team in developing strategies that
help to earn the commitment of key stakeholders for its implementation.  The Focus
methodology includes three phases:<BR WP="BR2">
</P>

<P>	<STRONG>Foundation.  </STRONG>A working group of faculty, staff, administrators and other key
stakeholders evaluates the current state and develops a working statement of mission and
a common understanding upon which the college's distinctive capabilities and strategies
will be based.  Typical tasks and results include:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>		•Analysis of the environment and marketplace served.</LI>
  <LI>		•Review of stakeholder needs and competitor initiatives.</LI>
  <LI>		•Analysis of current strengths and vulnerabilities.</LI>
  <LI>		•Articulation of key elements of the mission: purpose and values.</LI>
  <LI>		•Identification of potential new fields of focus.      			</LI>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2"></UL>

<P>	<STRONG>Strategy Development.</STRONG>  Task forces, formed from the working group, and possibly
involving additional stakeholders, identify distinctive capabilities, measures of success,
and strategies for action.  Typical tasks and results include:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>		•Agree on mission: purpose and shared values.</LI>
  <LI>		•Identify distinctive capabilities and measures of success.</LI>
  <LI>		•Develop strategic direction and implications for resource allocations.</LI>
  <LI>		•Identify sensitive areas concerning implementation.</LI>
</UL>

<P>	<STRONG>Implementation.  </STRONG>Action plans are developed, and procedures established to integrate
these actions into the structure of the college.  The final phase provides the road map for
executing the plan, for extending strategic planning into strategic management.  Typical
tasks and results include:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>		•Prepare implementation plan, responsibilities, deliverables, dates.</LI>
  <LI>		•Agree on an accountability system for managing implementation.</LI>
  <LI>		•Adopt a communications plan for understanding and commitment.</LI>
  <LI>		•Agree on a method for maintaining the plan as a living process.</LI>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2"></UL>

<P><STRONG>Outcomes</STRONG></P>

<P>The expectation is that the strategic planning team will produce a summary level strategic plan,
including the following elements:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>	•Mission: A statement of purpose and shared values.</LI>
  <LI>	•Distinctive capabilities: Core competencies required to fulfill the mission.</LI>
  <LI>	•Measures of Success: To determine success in achieving the distinctive
capabilities.</LI>
  <LI>	•Strategies:   broad directional thrusts that drive resource locations.</LI>
  <LI>	•Action Plans: Key activities to implement the strategies.		</LI>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2"></UL>

<P><STRONG>The Strategic Planning Team</STRONG></P>

<P>The Mikes' experiences suggest a team size of not more than 30-35 people.  In addition, they
strongly recommend that the team be comprised of faculty (tenured and untenured, tenure-track
and adjuncts), staff, administrators and other key stakeholders (university personnel, advisory
council members, alumni, etc.).  As a result, strong effort was made to achieve a mix of
individuals who represent a wide array of views and perspectives, while assuring that the group is
balanced in terms of our current structure.

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
</P>

<P>Team members are required to prepare for and participate actively in all the workshops, and to
undertake information gathering, analysis and other projects before and after the workshops,
recognizing that the substantive content of the strategic direction must come from the
participants themselves.  Membership in the team also includes the expectation that the
participants will undertake active leadership roles in pursuing implementation of the changes that
identified in the process.  The following individuals have committed to be a member of the team: </P>
